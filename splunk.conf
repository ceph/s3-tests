## Usually you just need to configure this file ONCE
[DEFAULT]
## this section is just used as default for all the "s3 *"
## sections, you can place these variables also directly there

## replace with e.g. "localhost" to run against local software
host = s3.amazonaws.com

## uncomment the port to use something other than 80
# port = 8080

## say "no" to disable TLS
is_secure = yes

[fixtures]
## all the buckets created will start with this prefix;
## {random} will be filled with random characters to pad
## the prefix to 30 characters long, and avoid collisions
bucket prefix = YOURNAMEHERE-{random}-

[s3 main]
## the tests assume two accounts are defined, "main" and "alt".

## user_id is a 64-character hexstring
user_id = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

## display name typically looks more like a unix login, "jdoe" etc
display_name = youruseridhere

## replace these with your access keys
access_key = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST
secret_key = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmn

[s3 alt]
## another user account, used for ACL-related tests
user_id = 56789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234
display_name = john.doe
## the "alt" user needs to have email set, too
email = john.doe@example.com
access_key = NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFG
secret_key = nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnabcdefghijklm
